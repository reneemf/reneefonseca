<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a current Human Genetics PhD Candidate in the [Dahl lab](https://sites.google.com/view/andywdahl/home?authuser=0) at the University of Chicago interested in the genetic architecture of complex traits, risk prediction, and disease burden in diverse populations. Prior to attending UChicago, I was a Fulbright research grantee at the Universidad del Valle in Cali, Colombia identifying gene variants associated with glaucoma in an Afro-Colombian population.
